# 🎓 AI-Driven Enrollment Forecasting & Resource Optimization

## 📌 Overview

 Developed Random Forest and XGBoost models using scikit-learn and XGBoost, improving enrollment forecasting accuracy  with RMSE of 11.5(using Random Forest) and 6.0(using XGBoost) ,enabling data-driven planning for 50+ academic courses 

  Automated synthetic data generation with Python's Faker library and constructed pipelines with 15+ features (tuition, waitlist, retention, feedback), reducing preparation time by 30% and improving model training efficiency 

 Leveraged Sweetviz for EDA and formulated predictive features to improve retention targeting by 12% and reduce scheduling conflicts by 20%, enhancing course offering decisions
